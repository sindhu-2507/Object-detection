# Object-detection

The input will be a video.
Video is a sequence of frames. So we read frames per a particular instant of time and apply YOLO algorithm on them.
YOLO or You look only once is an alorithm which detects multiple objects in a frame in a single pass.
In one sliding window we have 2 or more anchors
